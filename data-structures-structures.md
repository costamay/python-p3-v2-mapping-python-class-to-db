<!-- data structures and algorithms -->
data structure => collection of information => list & dictionary
storing values
relationships btw those values
methods for interacting with those values

<!-- str => upper, lower, charAt -->

algorithm => steps to solving a problem

class String:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def upper(self):
        pass
    def lower(self):
        pass

s  = String("Hello")
s.upper => HELLO
s.lower() => hello

=> for efficiency => time to execute 
Big O Notation => space & time
<!-- big o time complexities are -->
constant => o(1) => getting with the key
logarithmic => o(log n) => binary search
linear => 0(n) => iterating through a list
quadratic => o(n**2) => nested loops

<!-- different data structures -->
set => no duplicates
stack => LIFO => Last In Firts Out
queue => FIFO =>First In First Out
linked list > singly & doubly
tree
